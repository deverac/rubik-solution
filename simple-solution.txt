  The following algorithms can be used to solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube.

             HS = (F R' F' R)
             y  = Rotate cube so Right face becomes Front face
             z  = Rotate cube so Up face becames Right face

                             _                          HS y z

                 :'-,: F :'-,_,-':   :,-':    R   = Right face
             :'-,:   :'-,:   : W :,-':   :    S   = Swap edges
             : 2 :'-,:   :'-,:,-': R :,-':    F   = Flip edges
              '-,: 1 :'-,: F :   :,-':   :    W   = Swap corners (and swap N)
                 :'-,:   :'-,:,-':   :,-'   0,1,2 = # spots on Front
                 : 0 :'-,:   : W :,-'
                  '-,:    '-,:,-'

  Use  intuitive  moves, HS,  and/or SWAP  EDGES to  position each of the four
  edge-cubies of the Down layer, then the middle layer, then the Up layer. Use
  FLIP EDGES as needed to orient all edge-cubies.

  Choose one face to be the target face.  Use SWAP  CORNERS,  manipulating the
  cube  and/or  faces as  needed, to  correctly  position and  orient the four
  corner-cubies of the target face.  (SWAP CORNERS also works when the cube is
  rotated 120 degrees about a corner.) Make the target face the Down face. Use
  SWAP CORNERS to move a corner-cubie from the Up layer to the Down layer.

  Rotate the Up  layer  until the  corner-cubie in the Down layer is  directly
  below  its  home   position  in  the  Up  layer.  Apply  SWAP  CORNERS.  The
  corner-cubie  from the Down  layer will move to its home  position in the Up
  layer and the Down layer will receive a new corner-cubie. Repeat the process
  (of  rotating  the Up  layer  and  swapping  corner-cubies)  until the  four
  corner-cubies of the Up layer are in their home  positions.  When  complete,
  make the Up face the Front face.

  Count the  number of corner  squares  ('spots') on the Front face that match
  the Front  color.  Rotate the cube  around the  z-axis  (Front face) until a
  square with the  Front color  occupies '0', '1', or '2'; the  number that is
  occupied must equal the spot-count. Apply TWIST CORNERS. Repeat this process
  (of counting, rotating, and TWIST CORNERS) until the cube is solved.
